    <h2>Installation Wizard</h2>
    <p>
      The Linked Media Framework is a general purpose framework for building Linked Data and 
      Semantic Web applications. LMF bundles together Apache Marmotta, Apache Stanbol, Apache
      Solr and Open Refine. It provides commonly used services linked Linked Data Server, 
      Linked Data Client, SPARQL Endpoint, Semantic Search, Rule-based Reasoner, Versioning, etc. 
      that can be used for building custom Semantic Web applications using e.g. the LMF Client 
      Libraries available on the project website.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wizard will guide you through a basic installation of the Linked Media Framework Server. 
      It is a fully self-contained installation, meaning there are no other dependencies than Java 
      itself. The installer will install Apache Tomcat ${TOMCAT_VERSION}, the LMF Web and Core modules,
      and optionally all modules that you select in the following panels.
